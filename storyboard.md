# ðŸ§  Lung Cancer Prediction with 10 Machine Learning Models

## This project implements lung cancer prediction using 10 machine learning classifiers from the Scikit-learn and XGBoost libraries in Python. 

The goal is to develop robust predictive models that can assess the likelihood of **lung cancer** based on various health and lifestyle factors.
